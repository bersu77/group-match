# GroupMatch

## What I Built

Key features I chose include:

• **User Authentication with Firebase**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.

• **Group Creation & Join Requests**: Users can create groups or request to join existing ones.

• **Group Exploration**: Groups can discover other groups that share similar vibes.

• **Mutual Match Chat**: If two groups like each other, a chat opens automatically, allowing direct messaging.

• **Profile Management**: Users and groups can edit their profiles with relevant information.

• **Notifications**: Users receive alerts for new messages, group requests, and matches.

## What I Intentionally Left Out

Some features were not included due to time and resource constraints:

• **Google Authentication (Google Sign-In)**: Left out to avoid deployment issues and complex debugging within the available timeframe.

• **Media Sharing in Chat (Images & Videos)**: Limited storage prevented implementing file sharing.

## What I'd Do Next With More Time

With additional development time, I would enhance the platform with:

• **Inviting Users via Email & Social Media**: Allow users to invite friends and share groups externally.

• **Advanced Group Management**: Enable adding/removing members and assigning permissions for group admins.

• **Enhanced Chat Features**: Voice messages, text-specific replies, seen status, and status updates.

• **Merging Groups**: Allow merged groups to merge with other groups while maintaining all functionality.

• **Expanded Notifications**: More customizable alerts for group activity, mentions, and system updates.
